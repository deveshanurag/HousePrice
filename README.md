# House Prices Prediction - Kaggle Competition

## Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. It is based on the Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition. The model achieves a very low **log square error of 0.15604**, indicating high accuracy in predictions.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Handling missing values and categorical variables
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
- Performance evaluation using log square error

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for model training
- Random Forest Regressor & Logistic Regression
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

## Results

The model achieves a **log square error of 0.15604**, which is a strong indicator of its effectiveness in predicting house prices accurately.

## Dataset

The dataset is obtained from the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).
